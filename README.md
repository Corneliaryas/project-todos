# Project Todos

A mobile-first todo app. To add, remove, check, and uncheck tasks. Made with react and redux toolkit. 

## The process

The first time writing my own reducers in redux I of course stumbled upon a few tricky parts but I started with sketching and designing in Figma to get a clear picture of what I needed. That helped me see what components to create and what properties needed to be included in the state. 

I would like to fix the issues displayed in the console of not sending a serialized value to the state from the due date picker. If I had more time I would also make it responsive, add the possibility of adding different categories for different tasks, and a message when there are no tasks in the list.
